It's for ambitious people who want to do great things. Who know they have the ability, but struggle to act once their initial burst of motivation disappears. Using this service, they can fuel themselves with external motivation. Until the next burst of internal motivation kicks in.",

However, if you fail to do so, we will charge you a penalty and send the money to the charity you picked in your contract.",

If there's anything you are extremely uncomfortable with regarding social media posts that would cause immense mental anguish for you, there is no need to go with this option.

For example, if your goal is to lose weight, then the verification method might be you sending us a small video clip of getting on the scale and showing the result. The goal of verification is not to get incontrovertible proof of your actions, rather it is a measure to increase your accountability. Of course, if you put in the effort to forge plausible proof, you can fool us. But we trust you will be repulsed by the idea of putting in work to forge proof of something that you willingly signed yourself up to do.",
