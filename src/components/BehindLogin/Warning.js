            {" "}
            Choose progressive penalties for habit-forming and lifestyle
            changes. <br />
            When you are forming a habit such as going to the gym every day or
            switching to a new diet, it's hard to stay perfect. Choosing
            progressive penalties lets you miss a day, but at a cost. It also
            encourages you to get back on track ASAP before you lose even more
            money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: You form a contract to run every day for 10 days or lose
            $100. Sadly, you miss one day of running. Instead of losing the
            whole $100, you only lose $10. <em> (1/10 * $100).</em>{" "}

          <strong>Static Penalties:</strong> <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            You are charged the whole penalty even if you miss your goal by a
            tiny bit.
          </p>{" "}
          <strong>Recommendation:</strong> <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            Choose static penalties for one-off goals such as: Launching your
            website. Starting a youtube channel. Enrolling in a class. <br />
            For these goals the difference between almost doing it and actually
            doing it is huge. By choosing a static penalty, you force yourself
            to take the final step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: You form a contract to launch your website in 10 days or
            lose $100. Sadly, you only finish 95% of the work and do not
            launch. You are charged the entire penalty.{" "}
